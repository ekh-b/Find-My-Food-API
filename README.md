# Find-My-Food-API

This is a group project made in collaboration by:

- Eleasha Bains
- Bashi Abduwali
- Natalie Bruce

## Project Overview:

The purpose of the find my food website is to create a useful tool to help users find food based on their location.
Our users are most likely food enthusiasts or people travelling and on the go, trying to find a bite to eat.
The website will contain a map to locate restaurants the area based on the users search and a currency exchange to help with budgeting.

This app is particularly good for users on the go and users that are looking for a quick solution for some of their travel needs.
